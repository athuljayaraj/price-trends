      <div class="description element">
        <p>Groceries and daily essentials go through price fluctuations every now and then. This project uses
          visualizations
          to speak about insights from historical data on retail prices of daily essentials including milk, meat, towels
          and more.
          There are a few interesting facts and hidden insights on price trends of consumer goods, hidden behind the vast
          data. A
          comparison of the general inflation rate with product price trends to find unusual behaviors is also present.
          The seasonal variation in price of farm-produces, the dependency of bread on wheat, and a tool to calculate the
          financial damage
          smoking causes is all out there in the form of charts and dashboards. A custom-build helper is present for each
          of the visualizations
          to help user onboard and read the insights easily. Most of the visualizations make use of mouse hover to drive
          users interest
          to specific areas, and highlight interesting components.

          <h1>Seasonal trends</h1>
          <p>On the graphic, we can observe that multiple products follow a seasonal trend. Preselected products are
            shown
            in the combobox.
            They are sorted by the one with the most visible seasonal trends to those with smaller seasonal trends. With
            this, we can see
            that some products depends of the season of each product production. It is the case for carrots which have
            their lower price
            in september and their higher price in june. The same applies for onions and oranges (not sure oranges).
            The wheat harvest season <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/cereal-crops">starting
              mid
              july/august</a>,
            it corresponds to the point where less flour is available and so the price increase

          <h1>Product outliers: Products with the biggest and smallest price variation</h1>
          <p>The graph opposite shows the products that had the biggest price changes according
            to the period chosen. The three products with the largest price change and the three
            products with the smallest price change. Use the controls to play with the visualization.
            You will see, for example, that between September 1996 and November 2001, the three products
            with the biggest price changes were cigarettes, rib roast premium and sirloin steak.
            Those with the smallest price change are macaroni, toothpaste and tomato juice.
            The cigarette stands out by having had, in all periods of time, the biggest price increase.</p>

          <p>On the following graphic we can see all products plotted for the full period. We can see in green the top 6
            product where the price growth rate deviates multiple times from the inflation curve. This products are
            onions, carrots, potatoes, roasted coffee, peanut butter and canned salmon.</p>

          <h1>Similar trend</h1>
          <p>We can see that multiple types of products share similar trends. We can classify these groups of products
            of similar trends in 3 categories: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Products of similar food categories with similar trends</li>
            <li>Products of similar food categories with different trends</li>
            <li>Products of different food categories with similar trends</li>
            <li>Products of different food categories with different trends</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The three first categories can be intesresting to investigate. We will do so in the following graphics</p>
          <h2>Products of similar food categories with similar trends</h2>
          <p>We can observe that some categories have the same trends. It is especially visible for the group Meat 1.
            Due to their similar constraints,
            meats share similar trends. We can observe especially a similar growth in meats prices between 2014 and
            2016. </p>
          <p>The group Carrots-Onions is also interesting: we can observe a similar periodicity in the variation of
            these two products</p>

          <h2>Products of similar food categories with different trends</h2>
          <p>For the group hot drinks we can clearly see two different trends for the coffees and the tea. At the start,
            we can clearly see a decrease in the price of coffees prices up until 2022 and then a stronger increase from
            2008 to 2012. Tea on the contrary, even if it follows an attenuated version of the trend of coffee. We can
            also see this different trends for some fruits. The orange and apples follow a similar increasing with
            regular spikes pattern, whereas the bananas have only experienced a growth in price after 2008 but keep
            globally a stable price</p>

          <h2>Products of different food categories with similar trends</h2>
          <p>But we can also find products that share common trends even if the do not belong to the same product
            categories.
            We can see here two examples where the paper towel has similar trends as the baby food and where the eggs,
            bread, tomatoe juice and toothpaste share common trends
