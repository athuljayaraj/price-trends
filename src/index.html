        <h1>Seasonal trends</h1>
        <p>On the graphic, we can observe that multiple products follow a seasonal trend. Preselected products are shown
          in the combobox.
          They are sorted by the one with the most visible seasonal trends to those with smaller seasonal trends. With
          this, we can see
          that some products depends of the season of each product production. It is the case for carrots which have
          their lower price
          in september and their higher price in june. The same applies for onions and oranges (not sure oranges).
          The wheat harvest season <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/cereal-crops">starting mid
            july/august</a>,
          it corresponds to the point where less flour is available and so the price increase

        <p>On the following graphic we can see all products plotted for the full period. We can see in green the top 6 product where the price growth rate deviates multiple times from the inflation curve. This products are onions, carrots, potatoes, roasted coffee, peanut butter and canned salmon.</p>

        <h1>Similar trend</h1>
        <p>We can see that multiple types of products share similar trends. We can classify these groups of products of similar trends in 3 categories: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Products of similar food categories with similar trends</li>
            <li>Products of similar food categories with different trends</li>
            <li>Products of different food categories with similar trends</li>
            <li>Products of different food categories with different trends</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The three first categories can be intesresting to investigate. We will do so in the following graphics</p>
        <h2>Products of similar food categories with similar trends</h2>
        <p>We can observe that some categories have the same trends. It is especially visible for the group Meat 1. Due to their similar constraints, 
          meats share similar trends. We can observe especially a similar growth in meats prices between 2014 and 2016. </p>
          <p>The group Carrots-Onions is also interesting: we can observe a similar periodicity in the variation of these two products</p>

        <h2>Products of similar food categories with different trends</h2>
        <p>For the group hot drinks we can clearly see two different trends for the coffees and the tea. At the start, we can clearly see a decrease in the price of coffees prices up until 2022 and then a stronger increase from 2008 to 2012. Tea on the contrary, even if it follows an attenuated version of the trend of coffee. We can also see this different trends for some fruits. The orange and apples follow a similar increasing with regular spikes pattern, whereas the bananas have only experienced a growth in price after 2008 but keep globally a stable price</p>

        <h2>Products of different food categories with similar trends</h2>
        <p>But we can also find products that share common trends even if the do not belong to the same product categories.
          We can see here two examples where the paper towel has similar trends as the baby food and where the eggs, bread, tomatoe juice and toothpaste share common trends
